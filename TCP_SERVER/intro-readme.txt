Congratulations on successfully sshing to your coding round virtual machine!

You've found this text file in the "codinground" folder of your home directory (/home/candidate).

This file is just a placeholder. When the coding round starts, a folder named "questions" (or a file named questions.txt) will appear in this folder (/home/candidate/codinground). Once it appears, you can start reading the questions inside, and implementing them. We expect your code to be placed alongside the questions, before you leave the coding round.

All the best!
